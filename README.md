- [ ] For the current move only, show “You are at move #…” instead of a button.
- [ ] Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
- [ ] Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
- [ ] When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win (and when no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw).
- [ ] Display the location for each move in the format (row, col) in the move history list.
